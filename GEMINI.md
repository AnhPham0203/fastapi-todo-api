# Project: Full-Stack Todo Application

This project is a full-stack web application for managing a to-do list. It features a modern frontend built with React and a robust backend powered by FastAPI.

## Key Technologies

*   **Frontend:**
    *   Framework: React (using Vite for the build tool)
    *   UI Library: Chakra UI
    *   Authentication: Firebase Authentication (client-side)
*   **Backend:**
    *   Framework: FastAPI (Python)
    *   Database: SQLAlchemy ORM with a SQLite database (`sql_app.db`)
    *   Authentication:
        *   JWT for session management.
        *   Firebase Admin SDK for token verification.

## High-Level Goal

The primary goal is to provide a simple and secure platform where users can register, log in, and manage their personal to-do items. The frontend application communicates with the backend API to perform all necessary actions.
